# HelloWorld Collections

A simple archive of all my old projects from school and college days. These repositories may be small or basic, but I’m keeping them here for nostalgia and reference.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project is in its own folder, please check the README file inside each folder for specific details about that project. The projects are organized by language and type.

## 🚀 How to Browse

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ragarwalll/helloworld-collections.git
   ```
2. Enter the folder of any project to explore its code and read its own README.

## 🤝 Contributing

If you find any of these old projects useful or want to suggest improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
